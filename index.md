I'm doing Master's in Computer Science at SUNY Bighamton (May 2018 expected).
I’ve done Bachelor's in Engineering in Information Technology from Pune
Institute of Computer Technology, University of Pune (2013). Never thought I’ll
be proud of it. 

#### My Setup

I use *Ubuntu* as my primary OS. I've tried Debian, Arch & Mint (don't judge
me), but none of them gave me a solid combination of stability, regular updates
and simplicity. 

I use *zsh* + *tmux* (because nothing beats that combo) and *vim* as my
~~primary~~ only text editor. I primarly code in *Python*, *Go* for serious
projects, although I have plenty of experience with *C*, *JavaScript*. I've
dabbled with *Clojure*. I ~~try to~~ explore new languages sometimes.

I have a *Moto X (2nd Gen)*, which runs Android Marshmallow and is rooted
(because why wouldn't you?!). I avoid using my phone as much as possible by
mostly reading Sci-Fi, Comics and occasionally some Crime-Mystery novels on my
*Kindle Touch*.

I'm virtually known as ***decached***. Find me on [Twitter][twitter],
[Quora][quora], [GitHub][github], [LinkedIn][linkedin] or let's [{{ site.email

I also have a personal blog [kothawale.com](https://kothawale.com)
