I saw many of my friends using timeline, and I was dying to know what exactly
it is. I tried signing up for it, browsed through the settings tab. Couldn't
find an option to enable it anywhere. I googled it, found a blog which had the
following procedure. And guess what? It worked. :D

I would suggest you to use this only if you are a developer, as this concept is
still in beta phase and does have bugs. 

Here it goes:

1. Log into Facebook.

2. Enable developer mode, if you haven’t already. To do this, type “developer”
into the Facebook search box, click the first result (it should be an app made
by Facebook with a few hundred thousand users), and add the app.

3. Jump into developer apps (if Facebook doesn’t put you there automatically,
it should be in your left-hand tool bar).

4. Create a new app (don’t worry — you wont actually be submitting this for
anyone else to see/use). Give your shiny new app any display name and namespace
you see fit. Read through and agree to the Platform Privacy agreement. This is
the step you need to be verified for.

5. Ensure you’re in your new app’s main settings screen. You should see your
app’s name near the top of the page.

6. Look for the “Open Graph” header, and click the “Get Started using open
graph” link. Create a test action for your app, like “dump” a “chick”, or
“punch” a “guy”.

7. This should drop you into an action type configuration page. Change a few of
the default settings (I changed the past tense of “dump” to “dumped” — again,
only you can see this unless you try and submit your application to the public
directory), and click through all three pages of settings.

8. Wait for 1-2 minute(s).

9. Go back to your Facebook homescreen. An invite to try Timeline should be
waiting at the top of the page.

And you’re done! We’ve seen this work quite a few times now, so it should work
without a hitch for just about anyone.
